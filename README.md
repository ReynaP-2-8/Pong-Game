## Hi there 👋
I'm working on game design and creating a modification of a pong game using unity and in the process learning C#. To build the game, the base is off of the tutorial linked below. In the C# scripts, the tutorial parts are commented explaining where it is from, for each other part of the program, it is either part of Unity or an ingrained part of the tutorial, and I do not fully understand how it works. Everything else is my own ideas, but some syntax was learned from Stack Overflow and Unity Discussions. I am still learning how to program in C# and while the code may not be the most efficient, I came up with all of the pseodocode and ideas of what the game should do and how it will work by myself and reiterated by learning about Unity's capabilities. 

About how the game works, it is classic pong, but allows for 2 dimentional movement. A lot of the code is dedicated to making that work in a reasonable way, as I encountered many issued while handling that. Power-Up functionality is to be added next.
